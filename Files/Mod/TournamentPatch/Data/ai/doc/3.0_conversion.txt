1.) Replace core folder

2.) Replace files in SCAR folder (The previous folder \SCAR\AISupport is not needed anymore an can be deleted)

3.) Changes in all race folders:

a.) Add the following lines to the GetInfo(sType) function in the loader.ai file: (Example)

	elseif (sType == "HarassingLeader") then
		return "chaos_squad_lord"
	elseif (sType == "AutoConstructBuildings") then
		return false

AutoConstructBuildings is only true for Dark Eldar. HarassingLeader should always be the T1 commander unit.


b.) Replace the ForceTech() functions in the race specific buildbasestrategy.ai files

Remark: Chaos and SM have a special condition for build program 2. You might have to modify this part if your build programs are different from the original ones.


c.) Add HQEmergency() function in necronbuildbasestrategy.ai file.


d.) There are lots of race optimizations. If you have a look on the updated files, you might get some ideas how to optimize your own AI files.
    If your mod AI isn't too different from the original, it might be wise to copy the delivered race AI's completely.
